Blog Dashboard
Hey there!  I built   Blog Dashboard to manage and display blog posts. It’s all about being easy to use, looking good on any device, and running smoothly with some of the coolest tools in modern web development.

Features
Here  below features :

Displays a list of blog posts pulled straight from a mock API.
Lets you dive into the details of each post with a single click.
Includes a handy form to add new blog posts.
Works  on both desktop and mobile, thanks to its responsive design.
Sports a sleek, modern look with Material-UI.
Keeps everything safe and tidy with TypeScript’s type checking.
Handles API calls like  with RTK Query.
Technologies Used


Next.js: For slick server-side rendering and static site generation.
Material-UI: Brings in gorgeous, ready-to-go components that adapt anywhere.
TypeScript: Keeps my code in check with solid type safety.
RTK Query: Makes API management a breeze with smart fetching and caching.
