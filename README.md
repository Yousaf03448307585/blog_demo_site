Blog Dashboard
Hey there!  I built   Blog Dashboard to manage and display blog posts. It’s all about being easy to use, looking good on any device, and running smoothly .

Features
Here  below features :

Displays a list of blog posts pulled straight from a mock API.
Lets you dive into the details of each post with a single click.
Includes a  form to add new blog posts.
Works  on both desktop and mobile, with its responsive design
using Material-UI.
Keeps everything safe and tidy with TypeScript’s type checking.
Handles API calls like  with RTK Query.
Technologies Used


Next.js: For slick server-side rendering and static site generation.
Material-UI: Brings in gorgeous, ready-to-go components that adapt anywhere.
TypeScript: Keeps my code in check with solid type safety.
RTK Query: Makes API management a breeze with smart fetching and caching.
How to Run Locally

git clone https://github.com/Yousaf03448307585/blog_demo_site.git

Copy
cd blog-dashboard
Install dependencies:

No extra setup needed since we’re using a mock API—pretty straightforward.
